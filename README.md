# DC_DC_Buck_Boost_Converter
<details>
   <summary>Task - 1 -> Using MATLAB Simulink, I had first designed the circuit and then simulated it.</summary>
   
## Circuit Simulation and Output Waveoforms
1. I first designed the circuit and then ran it's simulation with the following specifications: <br>
• V_s (Supply Voltage)= 12V <br>
• L (Inductance)= 1mH <br>
• C (Capacitance)= 470µF <br>
• R_L (Variable load resistance)= 0Ω to 300Ω <br>
• Switching frequency= 20KHz <br>
2. Following are the screeshots of the circuit and waveforms of V_out and I_L at 20Ω load resistance:

   <summary>Task - 2 -> Implementing the converter circuit for on the hardware.</summary>
   
## My project is to develop a dc-dc buck boost converter.
1. I had first verified the working of the circuit on a breadboard and <br>
after successful implementation of hardware on breadboard, I soldered it on a purfboard.
2. Following is the image of the final circuit on the purfboard:
